The code is a Cash Flow Minimizer system designed to reduce the number of financial transactions among multiple banks. Each bank may use different payment modes, and a World Bank acts as an intermediary when there is no common mode of payment between two banks. The objective is to minimize the number of transactions needed to settle the net amount owed between banks.

Key Functions:
getMinIndex() and getSimpleMaxIndex():

These functions identify the bank with the minimum net amount (debt) and the maximum net amount (credit), respectively, among all banks.
getMaxIndex():

This function finds the bank with the maximum net amount that shares at least one common payment mode with the bank that has the minimum net amount.
minimizeCashFlow():

The core function that iteratively adjusts the debts between banks to minimize the number of transactions. It computes the net amounts owed or due by each bank, and systematically settles them by transferring amounts, either directly between banks with a common payment mode or via the World Bank.
printAns():

This function prints out the minimized list of transactions required to settle all debts between banks, indicating who pays whom, how much, and via which payment mode.
main():

The entry point of the program where it initializes banks, their payment modes, and transactions. It then invokes the minimizeCashFlow() function to reduce the number of transactions and displays the results.
Usage:
Banks and Payment Modes: Banks are defined with different payment modes, and the World Bank has all payment modes to facilitate transactions between banks that donâ€™t share a common mode.
Transactions: Users input transactions between banks, and the program optimizes these to minimize the total number of transactions needed.
